# Sorting Visualizer

A Sorting Visualizer built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and MUI. This project demonstrates various sorting algorithms through interactive animations, allowing users to visualize how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort work.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Generate a new array with random values and visualize sorting in real-time.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust the number of array bars and animation speed using sliders.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes with a modern design using Material UI (MUI).
